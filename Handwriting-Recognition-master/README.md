# How to run

For digit - `python digit_recognition.py`<br/>
For letter - `python letter_recognition.py`<br/>
For Android - `python hr_py.py` then install `app_debug.apk` in your phone, open app, draw digit and click `Predict`


# Files info

`android_rec.py` - Helper script. Receives as input the image from `hr_py.py` and returns the predicted digit<br/>

`digit_recognition.py` - The main script to interact with the user. Gives the option of recognizing a digit, training the model, testing the model and visualizing the dataset. Linear SVM is used to train the model and the model is saved in a pickle file that can be called again to test the model without having to train the model again and again. Selecting the  “Recognise digit” option opens up a Tkinter window where the user can draw multiple digits and get the predicted value.<br/>

`letter_recognition.py` - The main script to interact with the user. Gives the option of  recognizing a letter and testing the model. k-Nearest Neighbors with neighbors = 165 is used to train the model and the model is saved in a pickle file that can be called again to test the model without having to train the model again and again. Calling the “Recognise letter” option opens up a Tkinter window where the user can draw multiple letters and get the predicted value.<br/>

`extract_font (NIST).py` - Script to extract raw images of the NIST dataset and convert them to comply with the MNIST dataset configuration.<br/>

`extract_font (TTF).py` - Script to extract raw images from the font dataset and convert them to comply with the MNIST dataset configuration.<br/>

`hr_py.py` - Python script that creates a local server. The Android app when run on the phone sends the user drawn digit to the server and the server downloads it. The image is then passed to the ​android_rec.py ​which converts it to a 28x28 pixel image and returns back the result.<br/>

`painte.py` - Helper class involved with setting up the UI. Setups the Tkinter window, waits for user to draw the digit or letter, converts the image and returns it.<br/>

`MainActivity.java` - The single Java file of the Android app that creates the UI, waits for user to draw the image, connects with the server, sends the image to the server.
